# Backend

* The api was developed using Flask.
* The 'init.py' creates the database and inserts seed data.
* The 'requirements.txt' compile and runtime dependencies for the python backend.
* The 'src' folder contains the 'api' code. The main file 'app.py' configures the server, initializes the database ORM, and configures the multiple endpoints available.
